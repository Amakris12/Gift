    <h1>Dear Haley</h1>
    <p>Haley nicole senatore i love you more then words can describe. I love everything about you if i'm being totally honest. I love your smile, your ears face nose body feet legs back personality mind all of the above. What i ' ll love the most about you is your personality. You are honestly one of the most interesting people I have ever met. Whether it be just cuddling and watching movies and you say something that makes me die laughing or if we're out doing something and you say or do something that is so cute and funny I just love it. You make me the happiest man of all time you have no idea. I love you so much haley and everything you do. Your laugh is honestly one of the cutesting things ever. I love it so much. Your FRECKLES are so adorable i cant wait till our kids have them. Oh and how i could i ever forget your belly BUTTON. I haven't played with it in a while but I still love it. The best thing about you is definitely your heart. You're so caring haley, you're honestly one of the sweetest people i have ever met, when you aren't mad at me. Even when you're mad at me you are still cute and i love you so much haley. I can't wait till we get married one day hopefully and we have our house together and our two kids. I can't wait till one morning where they run into our room and wake us up because Santa came the night before with presents. I can't wait till we wake up one morning and have to take our kids to school for the first time. I can't wait till their first birthday. I can't wait till they take their first steps. I can't wait until they say their first word which will be “Mommy” and I can't wait to experience all of this with you. I love you so much haley.  Even though I know we aren't together, I still have hope that we will be one day. I believe that we are meant for one another and I love you so much. I hope you enjoy the rest of the site and I love you so much haley always and forever:).</p>
