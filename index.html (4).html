    <h1>Our Present</h1>
    <p>Haley I know this couldve been a lot better time for us but we had our moments. Definitly a lot of ups and downs. But im glad i got to spend it with you because we made countless memories. For example our first memroy back together was when we were a curtiss house and we were by the lake talking because i may have been crying. You asked me what was wrong and i told you. After that is history where we fell in love, made countless memories, and countless great expierences. My favorite one was our first date, we went to the movies and saw the new lion king movie. It was nice we didnt make out or do other things, all we did was cuddle and enjoy or company with one another. After that we walked aorund norterra and i remeber going to one of the stores by sauce, i think it was called the world market. We tried on glasses and scarfs and it was just a really good time. I hope you enjoy the rest of this page because its gonna show all of our memories together and our love:)</p>
