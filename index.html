    <h1>‚ù£To Haley Nicole Senatore‚ù£</h1>
    <p>Dear Haley</p>

        <P>Haley Nicole Senatore I love you for many reasons and I hope you never forget that i do. I have always loved you even though it may not show all the time. I do love you. I always have and I really can't wait till we get married one day. I can't wait to read our vows and say I do to show our everlasting love for one another. I cant wait til after the wedding where we dance to happy songs and then slow dance to our songs that we both love. Like our first song Talking to the Moon by bruno mars. I don't know if you remember this but after we took prom pictures together we slowly danced in your room together. I remember that because it was one of the times I think we were both truly happy together and it made me happy to do that. I would really like to do that more often because I feel like we both enjoy doing that. If i'm being honest haley i really do enjoy spending time with you and no matter how i act or what i do i love you. I know we're going to be married one day and be happy and have two or one kids.  Where i name one of you name one or we both name them both together. I believe that we will name them both together and if we are a boy I know wanna name it and I think you might have some ideas too. If it's a girl I have no clue if I‚Äôm being honest. Anyways i just wanna say i hope you enjoy this website and i hope it makes you happy.</P>
    
        <p>Sincerely Andrew Makris</p>

We just got finished watching a movie called the upside. Little did i know during this, I had just met the Love of My Life!</p><p>On the left: This picture was taken after school one day. We took this picture so we can have christmas pictures together and you wanted us to dress up all fancy. Personally i looked gross but you in the fancy red soft dress looked outstanding and gorgeous. I love you haley and this is special to me is because i lied to my parents about doing this because i had a D in a class and they said i couldnt go but i said i was going to the gym and not to take pictures with the most gorgeous woman ever!</p></div>
